  talktitle: "Utilizing Knowledge Bases for Text Retrieval: A Wishlist"
  abstract: "The development of knowledge graph construction methods and the availability of large general-purpose knowlegde graphs (KGs) have led to several advances in information retrieval (IR). For example, entity linking and KGs provide additional useful information about text and search queries, giving rise to more accurate models of relevance. This KG-enabled retrieval approach sets a new standard for several IR benchmarks. However, the exploitation of relational information in IR proves difficult for various reasons, such as low extraction recall, sparsity of schemas, and biases in the extraction pipeline. This talk discusses use cases and necessary conditions for successfully applying AKBC technology in IR. The talk entails a wishlist towards AKBC researchers for widening the impact of knowlegde base construction methods in information retrieval."
  bio: "Laura Dietz is an Assistant Professor at the University of New Hampshire, where she leads the lab for text retrieval, extraction, machine learning and analytics (TREMA). She organizes a tutorial/workshop series on Utilizing Knowledge Graphs in Text-centric Retrieval (KG4IR) and coordinates the TREC Complex Answer Retrieval Track. She received an NSF CAREER Award for utilizing fine-grained knowledge annotations in text understanding and retrieval.  Previously, she was a research scientist in the Data and Web Science group at Mannheim University, and a research scientist with Bruce Croft and Andrew McCallum at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at UMass Amherst. She obtained her doctoral degree with a thesis on topic models for networked data from Max Planck Institute for Informatics, supervised by Tobias Scheffer and Gerhard Weikum."

  talktitle: "Representation Learning and the Challenge of Reasoning"
  abstract: "Advances in machine learning (ML) have led to a golden age of increasingly rich models of language with large experimental gains in many language understanding tasks. In the midst of this plenty, we are also getting a better sense of where these new methods fall short. I will walk you through a collection of examples that are obvious for people but pose unsolved simple reasoning challenges to current ML methods. I will conclude with a few suggestions on how ML might be guided to learn useful reasoning patterns."
