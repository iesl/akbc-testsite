                <p>Extracting knowledge from Web pages, and integrating it into a coherent knowledge base (KB) is a task that spans the areas of natural language processing, information extraction, information integration, databases, search, and machine learning. Recent years have seen significant advances here, both in academia and industry. Most prominently, all major search engine providers (Yahoo!, Microsoft Bing, and Google) nowadays experiment with semantic KBs. Our workshop serves as a forum for researchers on knowledge base construction in both academia and industry.</p>

                <p>Unlike many other workshops, our workshop puts less emphasis on conventional paper submissions and presentations, but more on visionary papers and discussions. In addition, one of its unique characteristics is that it is centered on keynotes by high-profile speakers. <a href="http://videolectures.net/akbc2010_grenoble/">AKBC 2010</a>, <a href="https://akbcwekex2012.wordpress.com/">AKBC 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.akbc.ws/2013/">AKBC 2013</a>, <a href="http://www.akbc.ws/2014/">AKBC 2014</a> and <a href="http://www.akbc.ws/2016/">AKBC 2016</a> each had a dozen invited talks from leaders in this area from academia, industry, and government agencies. We had senior invited speakers from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, several leading universities (MIT, Stanford, University of Washington, CMU, University of Massachusetts, and more), and DARPA. With this yearâ€™s workshop, we aim to resume this positive experience. By established researchers for keynotes, and by focusing particularly on vision paper submissions, we aim to provide a vivid forum of discussion about the field of automated knowledge base construction. The AKBC 2017 workshop will serve as a forum for researchers working in the area of automated knowledge harvesting from text. By having invited talks
        by leading researchers from industry, academia, and the government, and by focusing particularly on vision papers, we aim to provide a vivid forum of discussion about the field of automated knowledge
        base construction. </p>

At Amazon we are building a Product Graph, an authoritative knowledge graph for all products in the world. The thousands of product verticals we need to model, the vast number of data sources we need to extract knowledge from, the huge volume of new products we need to handle every day, and the various applications in Search, Discovery, Personalization, Voice, that we wish to support, all present big challenges in constructing such a graph.

                              In this talk we describe four scientific directions we are investigating in building and using such a graph, namely, harvesting product knowledge from the web, hands-off-the-wheel knowledge integration and cleaning, human-in-the-loop knowledge learning, and graph mining and graph-enhanced search. This talk will present our progress to achieve near-term goals in each direction, and show the many research opportunities towards our moon-shot goals.

However, applying these ideas to problems in computational semantics has been difficult, at least in part due to modest dataset sizes and relatively complex structured prediction tasks.

                              In this talk, I will present two recent results on end-to-end deep learning for classic challenge problems in computational semantics: semantic role labeling and coreference resolution. In both cases, we will introduce relative simple deep neural network approaches that use no preprocessing (e.g. no POS tagger or syntactic parser) and achieve significant performance gains, including over 20% relative error reductions when compared to non-neural methods. I will also discuss our first steps towards scaling the amount of data such methods can be trained on by many orders of magnitude, including semi-supervised learning via contextual word embeddings and supervised learning through crowdsourcing. Our hope is that these advances, when combined, will enable very high quality semantic analysis in any domain from easily gathered supervision.

                             <div id="ivan_abstract" class="collapse">Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is an effective tool for modeling graph structured data. We investigate their applicability in the context of both extracting semantic relations from text (specifically, semantic role labeling) and modeling relational data (link prediction). For semantic role labeling, we introduce a version of GCNs suited to modeling syntactic dependency graphs and use them as sentence encoders. Relying on these linguistically-informed encoders, we achieve the best reported scores on standard benchmarks for Chinese and English. For link prediction, we propose Relational GCNs (RGCNs), GCNs developed specifically to deal with highly multi-relational data, characteristic of realistic knowledge
                            bases. By explicitly modeling neighbourhoods of entities, RGCNs accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in relational graphs and yield competitive results on standard link prediction benchmarks.

                             <div id="max_abstract" class="collapse">Representation learning has become an invaluable approach for
                              making statistical inferences from relational data. However, while
                              complex relational datasets often exhibit a latent hierarchical structure,
                              state-of-the-art embedding methods typically do not account for this property. In this talk, I will introduce a novel approach to learning such hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into
                              hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional PoincarÃ© ball.
                              I will discuss how the underlying hyperbolic geometry allows us to learn
                              parsimonious representations which simultaneously capture hierarchy and
                              similarity. Furthermore, I will show that PoincarÃ© embeddings can
                              outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent
                              hierarchies, both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of
                              generalization ability.

However, progress has been mostly restricted to extracting answers that are directly stated in text. In this talk, I will present our work towards teaching machines not only to read, but also to reason with what was read and to do this in a interpretable and controlled fashion. Our main hypothesis is that this can be achieved by the development of neural abstract machines that follow the blueprint of program interpreters for real-world programming languages. We test this idea using two languages: an imperative (Forth) and a declarative (Prolog/Datalog) one. In both cases we implement differentiable interpreters that can be used for learning reasoning patterns. Crucially, because they are based on interpretable host languages, the interpreters also allow users to easily inject prior knowledge and inspect the learnt patterns. Moreover, on tasks such as math word problems and relational reasoning our approach compares favourably to state-of-the-art methods.

                            data types, such as focusing on the text of the documents when extracting information, ignoring the various modalities of evidence that we regularly encounter, such as images, semi-structured tables, video, and audio. Similarly, approaches that reason over incomplete and uncertain KBs are limited to basic entity-relation graphs, ignoring the diversity of data types that are useful for relational reasoning, such as text, images, and numerical attributes. In this work, we present a novel AKBC pipeline that takes the first steps in combining textual and relational evidence with other sources like numerical, image, and tabular data. We focus on two tasks: single entity attribute extraction from documents and relational knowledge graph completion. For each, we introduce new datasets that contain multimodal information, propose benchmark evaluations, and develop models that build upon advances in deep neural encoders for different data types.
