AKBC 2019 will feature a few thematic workshops where you can deep dive into a particular topic and connect with other researchers working in the same sub-area. However, rather than deciding on the topics ourseleves, we are planning to open up the topic selection process and let the community decide based on discussions and feedback. Please visit [discuss.akbc.ws](https://discuss.akbc.ws) to join the discussion!

Current topics include:
* Neural and Symbolic Representation and Reasoning
* Scientific Literature Knowledge Bases
* Knowledge Bases and Multiple Modalities
* More coming soon!

If you have any thoughts, please feel free to get with touch with Xiang (xiangren [at] usc.edu) or Partha (ppt [at] iisc.ac.in)
